# How does it work

## Key structure (95)

**XXX-XXXXXXX**

The first part can be any number between 000 and 999.

The second part is like Windows 95 CD's, but simpler. The sum of the seven digits must be divisible by 7.

## Key structure (97/98)

The first part is made by 4 digits. The first two digits can be any number between 00 and 99. The third digit can be any number from 0 to 9, and the last number is the 3rd number plus 1 or 2 (if the 3rd number goes above 9, it overflows).

The second part is the same as Windows 95 CD's. The sum of the seven digits must be divisible by 7, and the last digit can't be 0, 8 or 9.
